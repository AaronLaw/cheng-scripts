# Problem: 
# The 701 Server program generates 2 new files every day, and so the "701 Server folder" becomes full a year later.

# Requirement:
# This script intend to clean up "the 701 server folder" by moving some old data (non-current *.msg & *.dut) to another folder.

# Usage:
# Install Python 3 and put this script into scheduler.
